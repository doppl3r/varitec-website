                        <h3>Climatec to Varitec. A 40-year legacy of leadership.</h3>
                        <p>Climatec was founded in 1975 as a small, one office, mechanical equipment manufacturer’s rep firm with seven employees.  Climatec was built on a passion to make buildings more efficient and more comfortable by delivering  a unique blend of leading products and expertise.  In 40 years Climatec grew into the largest privately owned building technologies provider in the nation with offices in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and California.  Climatec also grew into two divisions:  “Climatec Engineered HVAC Solutions” and “Climatec Building Technologies Group.”  Eventually Climatec’s Building Technologies Group joined with one of the world’s largest companies while Climatec’s Engineered HVAC Solutions took on a new name, Varitec.  Though our name has changed, ourcompany has not.  Same team. Same passion. Same legacy.</p>
